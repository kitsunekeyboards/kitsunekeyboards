Easy to use: 
The Kitsune Shapeshifter is flexible and easy to use; it comes presoldered and assembled so you can just plug it in and get to typing!
It also comes with hot swap sockets so you can put in the switches that YOU love! 

Compatible & affordable:
The Kitsune Shapeshifter is designed to be compatible with most standard tray mount 60% cases 
- making it more affordable because you don't need to buy another specialized case to work with this keyboard.


Ergonomics to fit your life:
Take the Kitsune Shapeshifter with you wherever you go! Its portable desgin means you can set it on top of your laptop keyboard and 
stop juggling all your keyboard gear from your desk to your next meeting. 
Ergomonics at hand are better than the perfect setup somewhere else (at home, your desk, wherever.)


From the creator:
I have SO many beautiful 60% traymount cases that were sitting on my shelf colleciting dust - I couldn't use them because I need more ergonomic support.
I created the Shapeshifter so I could use my beautiful handcrafted keyboard cases - built for a standard 60% keyboard - without losing any of the ergonomics I need.
